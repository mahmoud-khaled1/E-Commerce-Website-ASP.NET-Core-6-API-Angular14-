# E-Commerce-Website-ASP.NET-Core-6-API-Angular14-

 built a Angular 14  E-Commerce Website.
 In this Website, I have created <br>
 Home Component - To display Suggested Components.<br>
 Products Component - To Display List of Components in grid or in list layout<br>
 Products Details Component - To Display Details of Product.<br>
 Cart Component - To Add the Product in Cart and Save in DB<br>
 Order Component - To Simulate the Placing Order Process like other E-Commerce Websites<br>

All this will happen without refreshing web page.<br>
